# Spatial-Augmented-Reality-Real-Time-Photometric-Adaptation

I am only sharing "image warping of the projected captured image and fixing skewed image" portion 
of the code for your reference. The actual project involves coming up with a proof of concept to 
enable projection on a heterogeneous surface from a mobile phone in high definition. 

More details:
Created proof of concept of algorithm that enables projection on Heterogeneous surface that uses C++ using Openframeworks libraries on Codeblocks which improved the browsing experience of the user regardless of the mobile phone screensize with 2x better performance compared to existing algorithms
